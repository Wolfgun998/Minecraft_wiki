        <p>
            Legacy Console Edition is a discontinued term that refers collectively to several nearly identical editions of Minecraft developed by 4J Studios for game consoles. <br>
            The consoles with this version were:

            <li>Minecraft: Wii U Edition</li>
            <li>Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition</li>
        </ul>
        </b>
        <p style="padding: 5px;">
            Legacy Console Edition introduced new features such as a simplified crafting system, in-game tutorials, leaderboards, built-in mini games and split-screen multiplayer.<br>
            With the release of the Better Together Update, three of the platforms received an implementation of Bedrock Edition and because of that they are discontinued. <br><hr>
            By the end of 2020, all Legacy Console Edition games had ceased receiving new updates :(
